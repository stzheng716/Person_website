            <h3>Jennifer Horton</h3>
            <p>I've had the pleasure of watching Steven enter the real estate industry and grow significantly these past
              few years. He flourished first as a Closing Advisor, then as a Product Manager. He managed tough client
              escalations, developed deep subject-matter expertise in a multitude of arenas, and is a wiz at automating
              operational systems to enable scale and growth. He works well cross-functionally with other leaders in the
              company, and he has also become a well-respected manager in his own right. He grew and groomed his own
              team, leading his team members to become subject-matter experts in their respected functions. In our
              fast-paced start-up, Steven thrives in ambiguity and is always the first to raise his hand to help with
              key initiatives, no matter how hard the ask. He works tirelessly and enthusiastically to raise the bar,
              and he is an irreplacement asset to any team lucky enough to work with him.</p>

            <p>Steven has been an amazing person,His knowledge,skills,expertise in the work he does is commendable,I
              feel lucky to have a manager like him.It's been a great journey working with him.</p>

            <img src="images/adam.jpeg" alt="">
            <h3>Adam Silberfein</h3>
            <p>Steven and I worked together at Flyhomes, though we were different teams - Steven worked as Product
              Manager while I was working in more of a solutions architect role supporting his team. The first things
              that struck me about Steven when I met him were his energy and enthusiasm, which are truly contagious. I
              believe Steven made me a be a better developer simply because I wanted to live up to the vision he was
              able to create and share. That positive feedback loop led us to turn that vision into reality, and then
              quickly start imagining what else could be done. Once Steven learned a bit about how things worked behind
              the scenes, he started brainstorming on the next opportunity, even training up on some of the prototyping
              tools I was using.

              Steven's positivity, intellect, modesty, and commitment self-improvement would be an asset to any team,
              and I could confidently recommend him in a variety of roles. He's a terrific communicator whose can-do
              attitude elevates those around him.</p>

            <h3>Jade Fletcher</h3>
            <p>Steven is a dedicated, hardworking, collogue and friend. His professionalism and work ethics are second
              to none. He is a great resource and always willing to pitch in and help wherever possible; even when he
              didn't know the answer, he would work with the team to figure out a path forward. Many times when I hit a
              roadblock, I would ask bring him in on a meeting or brainstorming session and he would be there, no
              questions asked. Steven was the connecting factor in our group with his humor and inclusiveness. Although
              he was my senior in the company and team, he remained humble, open minded, and curious as to what he could
              do to make our team more cohesive and efficient. He is an asset to have on any team.</p>

            <h3>Katrina Koruga</h3>
            <p>Steven was an invaluable member of my team at Flyhomes and I immensely enjoyed working with him. We
              worked closely together to develop customized systems that fit the needs of our sales and and global
              operations teams. Steven is both patient and detailed oriented; he worked cross functionally with other
              teams to understand their needs and translated those requirements seamlessly. He does not hesitate to take
              on additional tasks to ensure the timeline of projects are met. Whenever I hit a roadblock, he offered to
              talk through the issue and was a great resource for me. He is energetic, enthusiastic and truly passionate
              about his work. He is a great asset to any team and I hope to work with him again in the future. </p>
